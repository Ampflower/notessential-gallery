  <b> The gallery for NotEssential </b>
  <br>
  This is where all the images used for NotEssential (that aren't icons) are stored. Well, at least at the time this was written, anyways.
  <br>
  Current galleries:
  <br>
  <ul>
    <a href="./crashes.html">Testimonies that Essential causes a fair few crashes</a>
  </ul>
</body>
